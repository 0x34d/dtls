// One of the content types supported by the TLS record layer is the
// alert type.  Alert messages convey the severity of the message
// (warning or fatal) and a description of the alert.  Alert messages
// with a level of fatal result in the immediate termination of the
// connection.  In this case, other connections corresponding to the
// session may continue, but the session identifier MUST be invalidated,
// preventing the failed session from being used to establish new
// connections.  Like other messages, alert messages are encrypted and
// compressed, as specified by the current connection state.
